# Wireless Hacking
## What is Wireless Network?
- A wireless network is a set of two or more devices connected with each other via radio waves within a limited space range.
- The devices in a wireless network have the freedom to be in motion, but be in connection with the network
- One of the most crucial point that they are so spread is that their installation cost is very cheap and fast than the wire networks.
- Wireless networks are widely used and it is quite easy to set them up.
- A wireless router is the most important device in a wireless network that connects the users with the Internet.
## What is Wireless Hacking?
 Wireless hacking is essentially cracking the security protocols in a wireless network
- granting full access for the hacker to view, store, download, or abuse the wireless network.
- Usually, when someone hacks into a Wifi, they are able to observe all the data that is being sent via the network with MiTM attack.
- In a wireless network, we have Access Points(AP), A wireless access point (wireless AP) is a network device that transmits and receives data over a wireless local area network (WLAN),
  - serving as the interconnection point between the WLAN and a fixed wire network.
  - Found inside the wireless router(we use in our house)
- A hacker can sniff the network packets without having to be in the same building where the network is located. As wireless networks communicate through radio waves, a hacker can easily sniff the network from a nearby location.
- Most attackers use network sniffing to find the SSID and hack a wireless network.
- When our wireless cards are converted in sniffing modes, they are called monitor mode
- And when your Wireless card allows to configure a AP on your laptop manually it is called Managed mode
- TO do most wireless Hacking , you need a device that can intercept or handle that specific signal.
## Wifi Hacking
- For this we need a wifi Antenna for our Computer.
- Most Laptops Have A wireless card inside of them but the desktops doesn't have. That's why they don't get any wifi networks on desktop .
- But the Adapter Have to have a feature called “Packet Injection+monitor mode”.
## Wireless network Algorithms
- Terms
  - SSID/Service set Identifier/: it is just the name of the AP
  - BSSID/Basic Service Set Identifier/: Mac Address of the Wireless AP device.
  - WLAN: Wireless Local Area Network, same as wifi
  - Channel: are smaller bands within WiFi frequency bands that are used by your wireless network to send and receive data. Depending on which frequency band your router is using, you have a certain number of WiFi channels to choose from:
     - 13 WiFi channels are in the 2.4 GHz frequency band
     - 45 WiFi channels are in the 5 GHz frequency band
- WIreless Network algorithms are algorithms used on setting up our AP, that helps to secure the network.
- There are Four kinds of WLAN Security Algorithms
  - WEP
  - WPA
  - WPA2
  - WPA3
## WEP - Wired Equivalent Privacy
- WEP encrypts traffic using a 64- or 128-bit key in hexadecimal.
- This is a static key, which means all traffic, regardless of device, is encrypted using a single key.
- A WEP key allows computers on a network to exchange encoded messages while hiding the messages' contents from intruders.
- This key is what is used to connect to a wireless-security-enabled network.
- One of WEP’s main goals was to prevent Man-in-the-Middle attacks, which it did for a time.
- However, despite revisions to the protocol and increased key size, various security flaws were discovered in the WEP standard over time. As computing power increased, it became easier to exploit for criminals to exploit those flaws. Because of its vulnerabilities,
- the Wi-Fi Alliance officially retired WEP in 2004. Today, WEP security is considered obsolete, although it is still sometimes in use – either because network administrators haven’t changed the default security on their wireless routers or because devices are too old to support newer encryption methods like WPA.
## WPA - Wi-Fi Protected Access
- this protocol was the Wi-Fi Alliance’s replacement for WEP.
- It shared similarities with WEP but offered improvements in how it handled security keys and the way users are authorized.
- While WEP provides each authorized system with the same key, WPA uses the temporal key integrity protocol (TKIP), which dynamically changes the key that systems use.
- WPA included message integrity checks to determine if an attacker had captured or altered data packets.
- The keys used by WPA were 256-bit, a significant increase over the 64 bit and 128-bit keys used in the WEP system.
- However, despite these improvements, elements of WPA came to be exploited – which led to WPA2.
- You sometimes hear the term ‘WPA key’ in relation to WPA.
- A WPA key is a password that you use to connect to a wireless network.
- You can get the WPA password from whoever runs the network. In some cases, a default WPA passphrase or password may be printed on a wireless router. If you can't determine the password on your router, you may be able to reset it.
## WPA2 - Wi-Fi Protected Access 2
- WPA2 operates on two modes:
  - Personal mode or Pre-shared Key (WPA2-PSK) – which relies on a shared passcode for access and is usually used in home environments.
  - Enterprise mode (WPA2-EAP) – as the name suggests, this is more suited to organizational or business use.
- Both modes use the CCMP – which stands for Counter Mode Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol. The CCMP protocol is based on the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm, which provides message authenticity and integrity verification. CCMP is stronger and more reliable than WPA's original Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP), making it more difficult for attackers to spot patterns.
- However, WPA2 still has drawbacks. For example, it is vulnerable to key reinstallation attacks (KRACK).
- KRACK exploits a weakness in WPA2, which allows attackers to pose as a clone network and force the victim to connect to a malicious network instead.
- This enables the hacker to decrypt a small piece of data that may be aggregated to crack the encryption key.
- However, devices can be patched, and WPA2 is still considered more secure than WEP or WPA.
## WPA3 - Wi-Fi Protected Access 3
- WPA3 introduced new features for both personal and enterprise use, including:
  - Individualized data encryption: When logging on to a public network, WPA3 signs up a new device through a process other than a shared password.
     - WPA3 uses a Wi-Fi Device Provisioning Protocol (DPP) system that allows users to use Near Field Communication (NFC) tags or QR codes to allow devices on the network.
     - In addition, WPA3 security uses GCMP-256 encryption rather than the previously used 128-bit encryption.
  - Simultaneous Authentication of Equals protocol:
     - This is used to create a secure handshake, where a network device will connect to a wireless access point, and both devices communicate to verify authentication and connection.
     - Even if a user’s password is weak, WPA3 provides a more secure handshake using Wi-Fi DPP.
- WPA3 devices became widely available in 2019 and are backwards compatible with devices that use the WPA2 protocol.
## WLAN Recon
- For any wifi sniffing Activity our adapter have to be on sniffing mode, means Monitor mode.( Default is Managed Mode)
- To Check our adapters mode,
  - Iwconfig
- To change it we will use a tool called “airodump-ng”
  - airmon-ng start <inferface>
- On Wireless Networks, The informations we will gather are the following:
-  - SSID/ESSID
  - BSSID
  - Channel
  - Algorithm
  - Manufacturer of the Router
  - To get informations about our wifi
  - airodump-ng <interface>
## Hacking WLAN
- Let’s see some Hacking methods for wifi networks.
  - WPS enabled
  - Handshake Bruteforce
  - WEP Attack
  - Evil-twin attack
1. WPS Enabled
- Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) is a feature supplied with many routers.
- It is designed to make the process of connecting to a secure wireless network from a computer or other device easier.
#### HOW?
- WPS uses some 8 digit code to connect. And attackers will bruteforce this pin.
- There are many tools on linux to do this but the simples and easiest way it to use some android apps like: Prevention ways.
- This is the most simples attack to do and Many script kiddies are into this.
- To prevent it, you just need to disable it from your router setting.
2. Handshake Bruteforce
- Handshake in wireless networks is the exchange of information between the access point and the client at the time the client connects to it.
- This information contains a variety of keys, the exchange takes place in several stages.
- It is a 4-way handshake.
- By default, the network card listens only for the packets addressed to itself. The monitor mode  enables the network card to listen to every packet in the air. Listening to all the packets can help the card capture the 4-way handshakes.
- Hackers will try to kick a person from a wifi(called deauthentication) and sniff the network, when the user try to connect back, they will have the Handshake file.
- This file can be brute forced and got the right password.
- For this:
1. Get wifi info
2. Sniff on that wifi specific channel
3. Deauthenticate the wifi(on different shell)
4. Get the handshake
5. Crack it with aircrack.
## Sniffing to the network
- On this Step we will listen to specific channel of our Target.
  - Channel: 4
- Syntax: airodump-ng <interface> –channel <channel> -w <filename>
     - The -w means write it to a file.
## Deauth
- On another terminal, we will start a deauthentication attack.
- This will make our handshake capturing process quick.
- As we saw the handshake is captured when logged user try to connect to the network back.
- So we will forcely kick him and listen for handshakes on our other terminal.
- Syntax: aireplay-ng -0 <size> -a <MAC_o_target><interface>
     - -0 means how many times the deauth is sent.
     - -a is the attack target.
- What kind of attack do this look like?(well known)
- NOTE: The tools we saw(airmon,airodump,aireplay) all are in the package of aircrack-ng sudo apt install aircrack-ng We need worklist Wordlists are a simple text files, with a list of words.
- You can create them by gathering information and making them a list
- Some already made wordlists, like rockyou.txt 
## Cracking
- On this step we will brute force the password and try to crack it.
- The time of the password gaining bases on the wordlist you have.
  - If you gathered and made your own Good wordlist you have a chance to get it.
- Syntax: aircrack-ng <cap_file> -w <wordlist>
## Prevention way
1. Using WPA3 which is a newer protocol is your best bet against such an attack.
2. To mitigate against de-authentication attacks
3. use an ethernet connection if possible.
4. use a strong passphrase (not a password) to minimise the attackers chances of getting it
  a. Example: my home wifi password is something like: “Helloworldthisismypassword”
b. This will be very hard to crack it wordlist.
3. WEP attack 
- The Steps are same with the Handshake bruteforce the difference is here we will bruteforce an encryption key not password. Also we don't capturehandshake,we just listen for WEP wifi for some minutes. And we will crack it with aircrack-ng.
## Evil-twin Attack
- It is an amazing attack. It includes
a. Deauthentication,
b. Fake AP and
c. phishing.
- The way it work is:
a. Attacker will clone one of the wifi he going to attack with making it open wifi
b. Then it will initiate deauth on real wifi, so users will be forced to be on the fake one.
c. Then the attacker will fake prompt to input the password to access the wifi
- This is the most Effective way to hack a wifi.
- That is why the name is “Evil twin”
## Warning
- For this Attack you need 2 Wifi Adapters.
1. To create the phishing page and Fake APs
2. To Deauth the users On the devices
- As i told you, if you have 2 adapters the second adapter will be used for the phishing purpose, As u see it is being deauthenticated and joins in to the fake AP Then we the phishing page will pop-up.
- This is very Amazing Attack type. And Can fool any one.
### Prevention
- Avoid Wi-Fi networks marked as “Unsecure”
- Use your own hotspot
- Disable Wi-Fi autosave
- Use a VPN
- Only browse HTTPS sites
## Bluetooth Hacking
- Bluetooth is a universal protocol for low power, near field communication operating at 2.4 - 2.485 GHz using spread spectrum
- The minimum specification for Bluetooth range is 10 meters
- When two Bluetooth devices connect, this is referred to as pairing.
- Nearly any two Bluetooth devices can connect to each other.
- Any discoverable Bluetooth device transmits the following information:
  - Name
  - Class
  - List of services
  - Technical information
- TO do A bluetooth Pentest u need a bluetooth adapter.
- Thank Goodness, our computer have it inside,and we can connect it to our Virtual machine too.
- Install the following
  - sudo apt install bluetooth bluez bluez-tools rfkill blueman
- We will unblock our bluetooth device
- We will start the bluetooth service
- To get information about your bluetooth device.
  - hciconfig
- TO Scan the bluetooth nearby
  - hcitool scan
## Bluetooth Attacks
1. BlueJacking: Sending messages over bluetooth
2. BlueSmaching: it is A DOS for bluetooth
3. Bluebugging: The attacker is able to take control of the target's phone.
- Bloover was developed as a POC tool for this purpose.
## SS7 Attack
- An SS7 attack is a security exploit that takes advantage of a weakness in the design of SS7 (Signaling System 7) to enable data theft, eavesdropping, text interception and location tracking.
- To allow wireless cellular and wired connection, the SS7 phone signalling protocols are in charge of initiating and ending phone calls across a digital signalling network. Most international public phone calls are made over the Public Switched Telephone Network.
- Other apps were gradually incorporated into SS7. This made it possible to roll out new mass-market solutions, including call waiting, SMS, prepaid billing, number translation, call forwarding, local number portability, and conference calling.
- For this purpose u need a device that can intercept a cellular signals
## Reverse Engineering
- Reverse Engineering is one of the greatest Cyber Security Field.
- As the name suggests we will reverse any thing that is  built up.
- Here Hackers will reverse engineer and Bypass many things, like the last time burp licencing.
- Every thing we use SOftwares are cracked by reverse engineers.
- For this You have to learn programming languages like, Assembly and C
- There are many tools used to reverse any software and get the assembly code for further review.
  - Example: IDA, Ghidra, …
- And White hats, use this skill to reverse any malwares and to analyze it.
