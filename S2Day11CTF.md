# Capture The Flag (CTF)
## What is Capture The Flag?
- Capture The Flag, as The name suggests it is Capturing a thing called flag
- It is a Security Game, That helps to understand concepts and to have a vulnerable lab to train on.
- Flag is a text,code,asked string/number.
  - Example: GEEZ{24erjawsfiasjf} , H3ck3r , …
## CTF Types
- There are 3 types of CTF
1. Attack- Defense
  - In these types of events, teams defend a host PC while still trying to attack opposing teams’ target PCs.
  - Each team starts off with an allotted time for patching and securing the PC, trying to discover as many vulnerabilities as possible before the opponent attacking teams can strike.
  - The team with the most points wins.
2. Jeopardy CTF
-  Jeopardy-style CTFs present competitors with a set of questions that reveal clues(Hints) that guide them in solving complex tasks in a specific order.
- By revealing clues, contestants learn the right direction regarding techniques and methodologies that are needed going forward.
- Teams receive points for each solved task.
- The more difficult the task, the more points you can earn upon its successful completion.
3. King of the Hill
- This kind of CTF is played in a team, the first who hacked the system and patched it will be the winner.
- Here the player will act like red team and blue team. And will hack it and also patch it to prevent other competitors(hacker) from getting into the system.
## CTF Categories
- On CTF games There are a lot of categories like the hacking fields.
1. Web
a. This type of challenges focus on finding and exploiting the vulnerabilities in web application. The maybe testing
the participants’ knowledge on SQL Injection, XSS (Cross-Site Scripting), and many more.
2. Forensic
a. Participants need to investigate some sort of data, like do a packet analysis on .pcap file, log analysis, and so on.
3. Cryptography
a. Challenges will focus on decrypting encrypted strings from various types of cryptography such as Substitution
crypto, Caesar cipher, and many more.
4. Reversing
a. RE usually needs participants to explore a given binary file weather PE file, ELF file, APK, or some types of other
executable binary.
b. Participants need to find the key by decompilation, disassemble using static or dynamic analysis, or other
reverse engineering tools.
5. OSINT
a. The OSINT idea is to see how much information is available to you and understand the underlying hint’s hidden in the challenges it-self with the help of  oogle and bit problem-solving skills. So more tools like sherlock, and no focus on domain enumeration, etc.
6. Secure code
a. A code is given and the game is to find the weak spot then changing that and running it will give the flag
7. Web3
a. This focus on the latest technology blockchain, you will find bug on smart contracts and so on
8. Boot2root
a. Here you will be given a IP address and the game is to find any bug and hacking that server/computer

### Websites for CTF
1. PicoCTF
2. TryHackMe

6. HacktheBox
## What is attack box
- It is a browser embeded linux system.
- You can start it and have linux enviroment for 1 hour/day
## Playing CTF
- Playing CTF is same as Hacking systems. So, we will follow all the hacking steps.
1. Information gathering
a. Here you will use all the ways we have seen to gather information.
2. Scanning
a. For hosts/networks: use nmap
b. For websites directory: dirbuster,gobuster,feroxbuster
3. Exploiting
a. Netcat
b. Metasploit
c. Burpsuite….
4. TO have post-exploitation and covertracking you have to learn “Priviledge Escallations”
## Write Up
- Write Up is a note which is written while playing a CTF
- This will help you to have a clear understanding on each steps.
- You will defined what you are doing in a create text, also with some screenshots.
- This can help other peoples to know how that CTF can be done.
